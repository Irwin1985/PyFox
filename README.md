# PyFox
## A VisualFoxPro PRG Forms based interpreter written in Python

For a long time I was thinking if is there a way to translate our SCX forms into another language in order to reuse all our logic or at least most of them and I think I can do it with Python thanks to its TKinter builtin library so this is an attempt to that project.

First you need to migrate your SCX with [FoxBin2Prg](https://github.com/fdbozzo/foxbin2prg) which is a terrific library for dumping all binaries out as plain text and then let PyFox do the magic for you.
